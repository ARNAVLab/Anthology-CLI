# Anthology
A C# translation for Anthology: a social simulation framework originally written in Typescript. Uses the .NET 6 framework.

# How to run
## Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2017(or later). This is to ensure support for .NET 6. In the Visual Studio Installer, ensure that the Universal Windows Platform development package is installed.

## Build
Open the .sln file in Visual Studio. In the Build tab, click on Build Solution.
This will build the solution with the default configuration Debug|Any CPU.
You can also build by opening the terminal in Visual Studio and running the command ``` msbuild ```. 

## Run
Run the application via Start Debugging. Visual Studio will build the application before debugging
if there was no previous build done or if the solution was cleaned.

## Usage
As of now, there is no GUI implementation (the default index page is simply a deception right now, sorry). To interaction with the simulation, please adhere to the following:

### Editing the start state
- Actions are read from /Data/Actions.json. Location and People requirements are both stored as collections, although the current implementation only expects one requirement of these types, so any additional ones will simply be ignored.
- Agents are read from /Data/Agents.json, so any changes to the simulation's agents should be made here and adhere to the existing format.
- Locations are read from /Data/Locations.json. There is currently no support for multiple locations occupying the same coordinates.

### Running and view the simulation's state
Due to the lack of a GUI, for simplicity's sake all interactions are performed with the following route mappings:
- **/Action/Print** displays all actions in the simulation
- **/Agent/Print** displays all agents in the simulation
- **/Location/Print** displays all locations in the simulation
- **/TempSim/Step/{n}** runs *n* iterations of the simulation, and displays all updated agent states. In addition, various higher resolution events such as action selection are logged in the command console.

# Dependencies
- Microsoft.NETCore
- Microsoft.AspNetCore
